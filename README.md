Backup script for linux directory.

Dependeces: rsync

This Bash script automates Linux directory backups using rsync. Users specify source and backup paths, with timestamps ensuring organized backups.
The rsync command synchronizes data, and old backups beyond 48 are automatically pruned to manage storage efficiently.
